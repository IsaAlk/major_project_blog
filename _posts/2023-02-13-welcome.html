<h2 class="section-heading">Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to use Near Field Communication for transmitting wireless power (WPT) from a NFC transmitter (reader) to a receiver (tag). The receiver harvests the energy and use it for providing power to a sensors system.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Objectives</h2>

<ol type = "1">
    <li>Use WPT in Near field communications</li>
    <li>Energy Harvesting</li>
    <li>Green IoT (Create a battery less system)</li>
    <li>System works on short range distance with low cost sensors</li>
    <li>Monitor the humidity/temperature of the environment and the moisture of the soil</li>
    <li>Data transmission through NFC</li>
</ol>

<p>I will build a system that allow to measure and monitor the temperature/humidity pf t and the moisture of the soil through NFC. This can be useful for personal use at home or for monitoring plants in farms or greenhouses. </p>


<p>The system will be composed by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>NFC Reader (a smarthphone with NFC support)</li>
    <li>Dynamic NFC Tag with Energy Harvester (ie M24LR) and Antenna</li>
    <li>Low power microcontroller (ie ATTiny85)</li>
    <li>Temperature/Humidity of the environment and the soil moisture sensors</li>
</ul>
