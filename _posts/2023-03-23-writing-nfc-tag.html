    The next step was to implement an example for writing/reading to/from the memory of the NFC tag.
    This is necessary because in my project I want to use NFC for both Data Transmission and
    WPT.
</p>
<p>
    I found
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST-Expansion-SW-Team/code/mbed-os-nfc04a1/" target="_blank">this library </a>
    that can help for achieving my purpose. It exposes a interface for interacting with my NFC tag (NFC0401) and allows to perform operations like
    write/read a URI and turn OFF/ON the LEDs on the Tag.

    I followed the example provided to understand how it worked. The communication between the microcontroller and the tag is by I2C as well, so now
    I need to connect 3 devices through I2C to my micro controller.
    Looking at the datasheet of my Nucleo 144, looks like there are other I2C pins available. But they are solder bridges

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <a href="https://ibb.co/2MvWqGF"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JpvmnDc/Whats-App-Image-2023-03-30-at-22-49-57.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2023-03-30-at-22-49-57" border="0"></a>
    <p style="text-align: center">Addition I2C pins</p>
</p>
<p>
    I tried soldering them, but then when using them they didn't work. I was not able to start an I2C connection between the microcontroller
    and the sensors/NFC tag using those pins.

    <p style="text-align: center">

</p>
<p>
    As I was not able to use the 3rd I2C connection, I retried using the I2C multiplexer.

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <a href="https://ibb.co/yQ1bcMK"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/sVGMdDc/Whats-App-Image-2023-03-22-at-21-19-25.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2023-03-22-at-21-19-25" border="0"></a>
    <p style="text-align: center">I2C muliplexer set up</p>
</p>
<p>
    In the above example I tried to multiplex to the 2 sensors. I tried several libraries, but with none of them I manage to make it working.
    I think the issue was on switching the channels when writing to a specific I2C device.
</p>
    Eventually I decided to connect the 2 devices per time (a sensors and the NFC tag) using the I2C and pretend like I was able to connect the 3 of them.
    More info about this in my next post.

    <h4 id="2">NFC data transmission - An hello world example</h4>
    <p>
        The interface provided by the library exposes 2 function for writing into the EEPROM: writeURI and writeWIFI.
        The example provided allows to write into the memory by pressing the user button, and the value written is either a URI or WiFI connection data (SSID, Auth, Encrypt, NetKey).
        There was not a function for writing simple text.
        Looking at the NFC native library, I found out there was actually a way for writing simple text. I tried to implement it and to add the functionality, but
        I didn't manage to do it.
    </p>
<p>
    I actually believe that I was not able to use the first NFC tag anymore because I went into a weird state while testing the above on it. Eventually,
    I bought a new one and didn't retry because I was worried to mess it uo too.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, I decide to use the writeURI function for writing my sensor data. The format will be stored like a URI,
    but I think it is OK as the purpose for me is just to demonstrate that the data can be transferred and made it readable by a user
    using a smartphone.
    The "dummy" implementation is an adaptation of the example provided by the library. I added some conditions saying that when the button was pressed for the
    1st time I would write the message "button1", 2nd time "button2, and 3rd time "button3".
