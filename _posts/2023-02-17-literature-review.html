<h4 id="1">Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer for 6G Internet of Everything Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</h4>

The paper provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges that arise from radiating near-field WPT.
With the transition of 6G systems to mmWave frequencies combined with the use of large-scale antennas, future WPT devices are likely to operate in the radiating near-field.

A limitation of charging wireless devices using NFC WPT is given by the very small distance required between the power source and the charging devices.

G wireless technologies will utilize large scale antenna arrays to communicate with user devices at the mmWave and sub-THz bands.
Therefore, 6G-based IoE devices are expected to transmit and receive EM signals while operating in the radiative near-field.

In such regimes, devices located at distances ranging from a few centimeters to several tens of meters reside in the radiating near-field regime

</p>

<p>
    The fact that IoE devices are likely to receive signals in the near- field regime combined with the potential beam focusing capabilities arising in such domains moti- vate the exploration of radiating near-field WPT for 6G IoE networks.
</p>

<p>
    The expected operation of 6G networks, which will utilize large antenna arrays and high-frequency signals, gives rise to several implications for radiating WPT systems.
    The short wavelengths of high-frequency signals facilitates packing a large number of antenna elements into a given area, forming a large antenna array of limited physical aperture.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The antenna gain stemming from using large antenna arrays has the potential of compensating for the attenuation of high-frequency signal propagation over distance</b>.
</p>

The paper demonstrates that despite the WPT for NFC requires a short distance between transmitter and receiver, there are techniques that allow to compensate this issue.
Given that the 6G networks are going to use arrays of antennas, the paper shows how to take advantage of this for increasing the distance (using the beam steering) in which a transmitter can transfer power to receivers using NFC.
