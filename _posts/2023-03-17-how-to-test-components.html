<h4 id="1">STM32 Nucleo32 (NUCLEO-L031K6)</h4>
<p>
    As microcontroller I initially wanted to use a
    In <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l031k6.html" target="_blank">STM32 Nucleo32 (NUCLEO-L031K6).</a>
    The main reason was due to the fact that it is a ultra low power
    microcontroller, and requires very few power.
</p>

<p>
    The IDEs I tried to use were <strong>Arduino IDE</strong> and <strong>Mbed Studio.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    I initially tried with ArduinoIDE, because I'm most familiar/comfortable in using it and also because I saw there is
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32" target="_blank">support for that STM32 board</a>
    and there are also few libraries ready to use for interacting with the sensors.
</p>

<p>
    I followed
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.sgbotic.com/index.php?dispatch=pages.view&page_id=48" target="_blank">this guide for configuring the IDE using the STMÂ£32 board</a>,
    and I managed to run a dummy hello world example that printed a message in the Serial console.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">Add STM32 boards in Arduino IDE</p>

</p>

<p>
    I had also to install the
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html" target="_blank">STM32CubeProgrammer CLI</a>,
    as ArduinoIDE needed it when setting an STM32 board.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">Issue when STM32CubeProgrammer not installed in laptop</p>
</p>

<p>
    Then I tried to read the temperature/humidity from the SHTC3 sensor and print it in the Serial console. As there are already few libraries, I tried to use them in my example.
    But I was not able to upload the code into the board for any of the existing libraries.
    The reason was because the board didn't have enough space in it.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">Issue when trying to load a program into the board but not enough free space</p>


    I thought that I could have tried to implement the reading of the data from the sensor on my own, but then I decided not to do that because I would rather to use an existing library if possible and
    , even if I did that, I could have not been able to upload the code anyway, as the amount of bytes of my implementation could have been more that the once accepted by the microcontroller.
</p>



<p>
    At this point I started thinking that I might not be able to use STM32 Nucleo32 for my prototype, due to the lack of enough memory storage;
    I decided to give Mbed Studio a try anyway, thinking that maybe there were light weighted libs for it.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately though I didn't even manage to run a hello world example with it.
    The reason was because this microcontroller does not support (the last version) v6 of the mbedOS, so I could not compile in it. The error log said I had to use Mbed OS v2,
    but this version is not supported anymore. Besides, you cannot download it at all from the IDE.
    Googling the issue I found out that this microcontroller could be compiled with mbedOS v5, but enabling just the bare-metal functionalities.
    I did that but then the code did not compile. I think it was because I had to change the compiler (from clang to an arm one). I decided not to go down this road because
    even if I managed to fix this issue, then I would not have been able to use all the functionalities provided by the OS (ie rtos), as I was abl to build a program just
    if enabling the bare-metal and disabling all the other functionalities.
</p>

<h4 id="2">STM32F429 Nucleo-144</h4>
<p>
    Therefore I decided to use the
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html" target="_blank">STM32F429 Nucleo-144</a>,
    instead, as this has much more memory and the NFC tag IC should be able to power this board too.
    I firstly tried with ArduinoIDE (for the same reasons I mentioned above), but I didn't manage to set it up properly.
    The problem this time was on showing the output in the Serial console. I found different threads talking about the issue, but the proposed solutions did not work for me.
</p>

<p>
    Then tried with <strong>Mbed Studio</strong>. This microcontroller supports mbed os v6 (yeah!) and it had enough memory to load the entire functionalities of the OS. I was able to compile and run also
    an example that used a
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://os.mbed.com/users/pilotak/code/SHTC3/" target="_blank">SHTC external library</a>.
    The program compiled and ran properly!
    Now I can see the temperature/humidity sensor value.

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Read temperature/humidity data from SHTC3 using Mbed Studio</p>


<p>
    Next step will be about reading the moisture data from the other sensor. Then I will need to figure out how to connect the NFC/RFID tag IC to the microcontroller and how to power it.
