    In order to power the NFC tag using WPT and making use of the energy harvesting, the datasheet of my microcontroller states that the ST LINK
    must be disabled, and for doing that there are 2 options:
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <a href="https://ibb.co/rmw7tYB"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kxSHyjL/Whats-App-Image-2023-04-05-at-01-06-12.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2023-04-05-at-01-06-12" border="0"></a>
    <p style="text-align: center">Disable ST LINK from microcontroller</p>
</p>

<p>I tried disabling it following option 2, but I didn't succeed.
    I would like to avoid removing the ST LINK cutting the PCB. From what I have been reading then I wonâ€™t be able to program/debug the microcontroller anymore and there could also be issues when powering it with WPT.
</p>

<p>
    But in theory, once my code is completed and uploaded into the microcontroller, cutting the STLINK should work and anytime I power the NFC tag using
    NFC the power will be transmitted from the TAG to my microcontroller, which will run the code and execute what I showed in my previous post.
