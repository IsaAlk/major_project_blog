    An NFC system is composed by:
<ul>
    <li>NFC Reader/Writer: This is the device that reads and writes data to the NFC tag. It can be a smartphone, tablet, or other device that is equipped with an NFC chip.</li>
        <p>

            <p style="text-align: center">NFC reader/writer</p>
        </p>
    <li>Antenna: The NFC reader/writer contains an antenna that is used to generate an electromagnetic field that powers the NFC tag and enables communication between the two devices.</li>

<h4 id="5">Block Diagram of NFC IC with WPT and Energy Harvesting</h4>

<p>
The NFC tag IC consists of two main blocks that are connected to the antenna ports.
The first block is the wireless power transfer unit, which is responsible for harvesting energy and powering the IC.
The second block is the communication unit block, which demodulates messages and generates the clock for data transmission to the reader.
<p></p>

<p style="text-align: center">Block diagram of NFC IC</p>
</p>

The wireless power transfer (WPT) unit is a crucial component of the NFC tag IC that enables the device to harvest energy from the electromagnetic field generated by the reader. The WPT unit consists of several components, including an RF limiter, rectifier, shunt regulator, and load modulator.
<p></p>
The RF limiter protects the IC from high-input voltage that could damage it by limiting the amount of power that can be delivered to the rectifier. The rectifier converts the AC power received from the antenna into DC power that can be used to power the IC. The shunt regulator maintains a constant voltage across the IC by dissipating excess energy, ensuring that the IC receives a stable supply of power.
<p></p>
The load modulator is a key component of the WPT unit and is responsible for modulating the impedance of the IC to ensure maximum power transfer efficiency. The load modulator can be modeled as a shunt capacitance with the antenna, and its impedance varies depending on the received power due to the nonlinear behavior of the rectifier and RF limiter. The load modulator adjusts the impedance of the IC to match that of the reader, which maximizes power transfer efficiency and ensures that the IC can harvest the maximum amount of energy possible.

<p></p>
<p>
    The communication unit is the other main block of the NFC tag IC, responsible for demodulating the signal received from the reader, decoding and encoding data, and generating the clock signal for data transmission back to the reader. The communication unit typically consists of a demodulator, decoder, encoder, and clock generator.
    The demodulator is responsible for recovering the digital signal from the modulated carrier wave received from the reader. The demodulator converts the modulated signal into a baseband digital signal that can be processed by the decoder.

</p>

<p>
    The decoder then decodes the data received from the reader and prepares it for processing by the IC. The decoder uses error-correcting codes to detect and correct errors in the received data, ensuring that the data transmitted back to the reader is accurate.
    The encoder is responsible for encoding the data that will be transmitted back to the reader. The encoder prepares the data for transmission by adding error-correcting codes and other control information to the data stream.
    Finally, the clock generator generates the clock signal that synchronizes the transmission of data back to the reader. The clock generator ensures that the data is transmitted at the correct rate and timing, ensuring reliable communication between the NFC tag IC and the reader.

<h4 id="6">Block Diagram of a NFC System with sensors powered by Harvested Energy</h4>
<p>
    Following an example of a block diagram of an NFC system with sensors powered by Harvested Energy:
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/KbqM7gf/Block-diagram-of-proposed-NFC-sensor-that-is-powered-using-a-smartphone.png" alt="Block-diagram-of-proposed-NFC-sensor-that-is-powered-using-a-smartphone" border="0">
</p>
<p>
    The system consists of three main components: the reader, the NFC tag IC with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities, and the sensors.
    The reader generates an electromagnetic field that powers the NFC tag IC and provides a means for wireless communication between the reader and the NFC tag IC.
</p>
<p>
    The sensors are powered by the harvested energy from the NFC tag IC and can be used to measure various physical parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and more.
