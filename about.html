        <p>IoT ecosystems are composed by distributed smart devices that are able to communicate between each other. A limitation of such systems is due to the fact that these devices are powered by batteries. Batteries can be expensive to maintain, as they require manual intervention for changing them. They could be re charged by cable, but this result in a very unpractical and unpleasant user experience. On top of that, batteries contain toxic components that can contaminate and pollute the environment.</p>

<p>Energy harvesting is not a new idea, lot of studies have been done in the past 100 years, but it was not really used in commercial application mainly because the amount of energy that can be harvested is very low. But in the last decade the efficiency of the devices used in such systems has gone up enormously. Therefore, the amount of energy needed by IoT devices has dropped dramatically. Meaning that nowadays it is possible to power IoT devices through energy harvesting.</p>

<p>Energy harvesting through NFC is based on the idea of converting a Radio Frequency into DC and then use the energy for powering a low power system. </p>

<p>NFC technology allows to transfer data/power through inductive coupling via induced magnetic fields between a transmitter and receiver coil.</p>

<p>I will build a system that allow to measure and monitorthe moisture of the soil and the temperature/humidity of the enironment through NFC. This can be useful for personal use at home or for monitoring plants in farms or greenhouses. </p>
