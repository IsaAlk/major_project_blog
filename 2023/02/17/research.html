<h4 id="1">Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer for 6G Internet of Everything Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</h4>

<p>
    The paper provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges that arise from radiating near-field WPT.
    With the transition of 6G systems to mmWave frequencies combined with the use of large-scale antennas, future WPT devices are likely to operate in the radiating near-field.
</p>

<p>
    A limitation of charging wireless devices using NFC WPT is given by the very small distance required between the power source and the charging devices.
</p>

<p>
    6G wireless technologies will utilize large scale antenna arrays to communicate with user devices at the mmWave and sub-THz bands.
    Therefore, 6G-based IoE devices are expected to transmit and receive EM signals while operating in the radiative near-field.
</p>

<p>
    In such regimes, devices located at distances ranging from a few centimeters to several tens of meters reside in the radiating near-field regime

</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/p4DXjG7">
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WB9Kvqh/1.png" alt="1" border="0">
    </a>
</p>

<p>
    The fact that IoE devices are likely to receive signals in the near- field regime combined with the potential beam focusing capabilities arising in such domains moti- vate the exploration of radiating near-field WPT for 6G IoE networks.
</p>

<p>
    The expected operation of 6G networks, which will utilize large antenna arrays and high-frequency signals, gives rise to several implications for radiating WPT systems.
    The short wavelengths of high-frequency signals facilitates packing a large number of antenna elements into a given area, forming a large antenna array of limited physical aperture.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The antenna gain stemming from using large antenna arrays has the potential of compensating for the attenuation of high-frequency signal propagation over distance</b>.
    The paper demonstrates that despite the WPT for NFC requires a short distance between transmitter and receiver, there are techniques that allow to compensate this issue.
</p>

<p>
    Given that the 6G networks are going to use arrays of antennas, the paper shows how to take advantage of this for increasing the distance (using the beam steering) in which a transmitter can transfer power to receivers using NFC.

</p>

<h4 id="2">NFC Sensors Based on Energy Harvesting for IoT Applications</h4>
<p>This paper describes how to build a NFC sensors battery less sensors system. The system is powered by harvesting energy from a the electromagnetic induction between 2 loops antennas.</p>

<p>There is a comparison of RFID technologies, which helps in understanding how they can be used in real applications</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/qrp7Fjk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XCtjkLS/2.png" alt="2" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p>It shows an example of how the NFC communication between the Transmitter/Reader works and a generic model of the Transmitter and Receiver</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/hfJ2tww/3.png" alt="3" border="0" title="NFC IC block diagram">
<p style="text-align: center">NFC IC block diagram</p>

</p>

<br />

<p>It provides also a list of existing NFC integrated circuits that include energy harvesting, and the amount of current/volt they can provide to feed sensors.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Commercial NFC ICs with energy harvesting</p>


<p>Then there are some advices about how to design and build a NFC reader and Tag. Particular attention has been dedicated about the NFC Tag</p>
<p>When designing an NFC Tag it is important to consider the environment where the tag will work, the application (as it will limit the area for the antenna) and the desired range/. It is a good idea to cover it with a sheet of ferrite
for example if the tag will work close to some metal, as it isolates the traces of metal and so it will work better.
</p>

<p>Finally it shows some NFC-based sensors system, and how they can be used for building battery-less seonsors system</p>
<p>

<p style="text-align: center">Battery-less NFC sensor system</p>
</p>

<p>
    This paper was really helpful because provides information about the NFC ICs with energy harvesting present in the market,
    a workbench comparing their performance and also some suggested usages.
    It shows the raising interest in the IoT community about building battery-less sensor systems and how the current technology is able to provide enough energy
    for powering them.
</p>

<h4 id="3">Wireless Power Transfer Using Near-Field Communication for Mobile Devices</h4>
<p>The paper shows how to create a prototype for transferring power using NFC and harvest the energy for charging a Li-on battery.
The work also provides an analysis of the system, with the aim to find the condition when there is high efficiency in power transferred. </p>

<p>It provides also an example of a schematic of for this system, which could be useful when designing my system:</p>

<h4 id="4">Wireless charging using NFC technology</h4>

<p>This article talks about the applications where NFC can be used for charging devices using WPT
    and how to increase the efficiency of the power transmission.

<p>The power that can be provided by NFC charging protocol is lower than the one provided by Qi:</p>

<br />
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/LPDXh5m/Screenshot-2023-02-25-at-22-00-02.png" alt="Screenshot-2023-02-25-at-22-00-02" border="0">
<p style="text-align: center">NFC Wireless Charging power class vs Qi power class</p>

<br />

<p>As the power class are different, the products targeted by these two technologies are not the same.</p>

<p>Then the article shows how to increase the power transfer efficiency.</p>
<p>The first way is to use the same antenna size for both the transmitter and the receiver. As the target are wereables, the size of the antenna must be small.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/bFb4c5v"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9hZxQH4/Screenshot-2023-02-25-at-22-15-37.png" alt="Screenshot-2023-02-25-at-22-15-37" border="0"></a>
    <p style="text-align: center">Impact of the antennas size on efficiency</p>

</p>
<p>
    The space between the transmitter antenna and the receiver antenna also has an impact of the efficiency.
<p/>

<h4 id="5">A Battery-Less NFC Sensor Transponder for Museum Artefact Monitoring</h4>

<p>
The paper present a battery-less NFC low-cost solution for monitoring Cultural Heritage objects. These artefacts are valuable objects housed by museums and are often stored in uncontrolled climatic (temperature/humidity) conditions, which may lead to degradation of them.
</p>
<p>
One critical disadvantage nowadays of monitoring the storage conditions in these systems is due to the necessity of opening the box when analysis are needed.

An NFC temperature and humidity sensor system would allow to monitor them without opening the boxes that contain these items.
</p>
<p>
The proposed solution is very cheap, as it cost 5 Euro and last around 5 years:
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/FYpQdk2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GMmZrfy/Screenshot-2023-02-26-at-18-55-42.png" alt="Screenshot-2023-02-26-at-18-55-42" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p>
The solution consists on an RF interface and a energy harvesting circuitry, which will connect to the loop antenna.

The energy harvester will harvest energy from the magnetic field of an NFC Transmitter, with the help of an internal rectifier and capacitor.
</p>
<p>
The harvested voltage will further be regulated using a low dropout regulator and will be used to power up an ultra power MCU and the sensors.
</p>

<p>
The main components of the system are:
<ul>
    <li>l031k6 MCU</li>
    <li>MIKROE-3331 Add-On Board, Temp&Hum 9 Click Board, SHTC3 Temperature/Humidity Sensor, MikroBUS</li>
    <li>Dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC expansion board based on ST25DV04K for STM32 Nucleo</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/GdwT5CF"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NFhSyW7/Screenshot-2023-02-26-at-19-03-52.png" alt="Screenshot-2023-02-26-at-19-03-52" border="0"></a>
    <p style="text-align: center">NFC sensor prototype</p>
</p>

The prototype shows that the harvested power from a smartphone with NFC is enough to run the system without a battery.

<p>
The article was really interesting because demonstrates that it is possible to power ultra low power sensor systems using NFC WPT, which is
the main purpose of my project.
